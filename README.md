This is the starter project for Rube Goldberg Challenge

James Guenther
Test Oculus (Add the Oculus plugin seems to clobber the Steam plugin so I stopped trying to add it)
Time: Months, I lost track
What was challenging: The bugs, gah!!!! Have to add VR to Unity project before the VR plugins or it gets clobbered. Had an power surge so the Oculus didn't like the USB port and I needed to get a new computer. Sometimes the project stops working correctly sometimes for no discernible reason
One thing I liked: Enjoyed building the levels
